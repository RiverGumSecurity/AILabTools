LogChunkID: 43/55  

---  

### Summary of Normal Activity  
- Multiple successful authentication events for users `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com` and `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from various IP addresses, including `34.224.94.68`, `73.121.154.15`, `172.221.112.235`, `2600:387:f:81b::1`, `3.80.218.146`, `13.57.246.62`, and others.  
- Routine mailbox operations such as mail access, mailbox configuration changes, mailbox plan settings, and token issuance for these users.  
- Conditional Access Policies and mailbox policies being set by system accounts (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM), which is typical for Exchange service operations.  
- Some SharePoint and OneDrive file and page access by `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from internal IPs.  
- Presence of a phishing email detected and moved to Junk folder, indicating active threat intelligence and filtering.  

### Suspicious Activity Discovered  
- Multiple failed login attempts (UserLoginFailed) for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP `3.80.218.146` with error `InvalidUserNameOrPassword`.  
- Despite failed login attempts from `3.80.218.146`, there are also successful login events from the same IP for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`. This indicates possible brute force or credential stuffing attempts that eventually succeeded.  
- Creation of a suspicious inbox rule named "SANS Mail" by `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` that moves emails containing header `X-MS-Exchange-Inbox-Rules-Loop: *@sans.org` to a folder named "Cyber Resources" and stops processing further rules. This could be an attacker trying to hide or redirect certain emails.  
- Multiple conditional access policies being set or modified, including disabling of default policies, which might indicate policy tampering to weaken security controls.  
- The presence of a phishing email targeting `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` with spoofed external domain and DMARC failure, indicating an active phishing threat.  

### IP Source Addresses Involved in Suspicious Activity  
- `3.80.218.146` (failed and successful login for `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`)  
- `73.121.154.15` (consistent logins for `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`, possibly legitimate but worth monitoring)  
- No clear evidence of brute force from other IPs in this log chunk, but `3.80.218.146` stands out due to failed then successful logins.  

### User Account Names Involved in Suspicious Activity  
- `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` (failed logins, suspicious inbox rule creation, phishing email recipient)  
- No suspicious activity directly linked to `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com` in this log chunk.

### Conclusion  
The logs indicate a likely brute force or credential stuffing attack against user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP `3.80.218.146`, which resulted in successful authentication. Post-compromise activity includes creation of a suspicious inbox rule to potentially hide or redirect emails, and disabling of default conditional access policies, which weakens security posture. Additionally, a phishing email targeting this user was detected and quarantined.  

Immediate actions recommended:  
- Investigate and block IP `3.80.218.146` if not recognized.  
- Review and remove suspicious inbox rules for `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`.  
- Audit and restore conditional access policies to secure defaults.  
- Force password reset and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`.  
- Conduct a thorough mailbox and environment review for further indicators of compromise.
