### Summary of Normal Activity

- Multiple successful mailbox and mailbox plan configuration operations performed by system accounts (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) related to Exchange service, which is normal for system maintenance.
- Regular mail item accesses by legitimate users "jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com" and "jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com" from various IP addresses, mostly consistent with known client applications (OWA, REST, WebServices, OneDrive, SharePoint).
- Frequent issuance of GATFR tokens (OAuth tokens) for users "jsteele" and "jkapoor" indicating normal OAuth authentication flows.
- SharePoint and OneDrive file access and modifications by user "jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com" from various IPs, consistent with normal user activity.
- Conditional Access Policies being set and updated by system accounts, which is typical for tenant policy management.
- User logins for "jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com" and other users from various IPs with successful authentication and OAuth authorization.
- Client IP addresses for normal user activity include IPv4 addresses such as 73.121.154.15, 34.224.94.68, 172.221.112.235, and IPv6 addresses like 2603:1036:2404::17, 2603:1036:2400::39, 2603:10b6:208:17c::15, etc.
