### Suspicious Activity Discovered

- **Creation of Inbox Rule by user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` on 2024-07-19T12:58:41:**
  - Rule named "Move all messages from SANS AtRisk to Cyber Resources" created.
  - This rule moves all messages from `consensussecurityvulnerabilityalert@email.sans.org` to a folder named "Cyber Resources".
  - This could be used to hide security alerts or vulnerability notifications by automatically moving them out of the inbox, which is a common tactic used by attackers to evade detection.
- No direct evidence of brute force or failed login attempts in this log chunk.
- No suspicious IP addresses identified as performing failed logins.
- The presence of multiple IP addresses accessing the mailbox of `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from diverse geographic locations and devices could warrant further correlation but no explicit anomaly or failure is shown here.
- No evidence of unauthorized mailbox permission changes or mailbox forwarding rules created by unknown users in this chunk.
- No suspicious authentication failures or unusual user account creations/modifications detected.

# Conclusion

- The primary suspicious activity is the creation of an inbox rule by user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` that moves security alert emails (from a known security alert sender) to a separate folder, potentially hiding important security notifications.
- No brute force or failed login attempts detected in this log chunk.
- All IP addresses involved in authentication appear legitimate and are associated with successful logins.
- Recommend further investigation of the inbox rule creation context, user behavior, and mailbox contents for signs of compromise or insider threat.
- Review other log chunks for brute force or suspicious authentication attempts if available.
