### Summary of Normal Activity

- Multiple successful logins and mailbox accesses by legitimate users such as:
  - User: `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`
  - User: `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com`
  - User: `gwootton@usculturaldynamics.com`
  - User: `justin@blackhillsinfosec.com`
- Activities include mailbox access, file uploads, file modifications, mailbox settings changes, and conditional access policy updates.
- Most logins and operations originate from a variety of IP addresses consistent with normal business operations, including IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- Several administrative operations performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)` which is normal for Exchange backend operations.
- Use of OAuth and other standard authentication methods.
- Use of Microsoft Exchange, OneDrive, SharePoint, and Azure Active Directory workloads.
- Use of MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) indicated by updates to StrongAuthenticationPhoneAppDetail for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`.
- No unusual or unexpected changes to mailbox plans or policies outside normal administrative updates.

### Suspicious Activity Discovered

- Presence of a **UserLoginFailed** event with `ResultStatus` marked as "Success" but with an error number `50074` and logon error `UserStrongAuthClientAuthNRequiredInterrupt` from IP `73.121.154.15` for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`. This indicates an interrupted login due to strong authentication requirements, possibly a failed MFA or conditional access enforcement.
- Multiple successful logins and mailbox accesses from IP `73.121.154.15` for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` shortly before and after this failed login event, indicating possible brute force or replay attempts.
- The IP `73.121.154.15` is involved in both failed and successful authentications for the same user, which is suspicious.
- Addition of an inbox rule by user `gwootton@usculturaldynamics.com` that forwards emails to `hal@blackhillsinfosec.com`. This could be a legitimate security monitoring rule, but it is unusual and should be verified.
- Multiple conditional access policies are set and updated, some with "Disabled" state, which could indicate a weakening of security controls.
- Some mailbox deletions and hard deletes performed by `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP `3.80.218.146`, which might be suspicious if unexpected.
- The user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` has multiple file and mailbox operations from diverse IPs including `73.121.154.15`, `172.221.112.235`, `3.80.218.146`, and IPv6 addresses, which could indicate account compromise or use from multiple locations.
- The user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` had their StrongAuthenticationPhoneAppDetail updated with a last authenticated timestamp changing from `2024-07-19T12:53:42` to `2024-08-06T19:10:46`, indicating recent MFA activity.

### Conclusion

- The logs show evidence of suspicious activity consistent with a **potential brute force or credential stuffing attack** against user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` originating from IP `73.121.154.15` (failed login followed by successful login).
- The same IP address was involved in successful authentication, indicating possible compromise.
- Additional suspicious activity includes mailbox hard deletes and creation of forwarding inbox rules, which could indicate attacker attempts to exfiltrate data or cover tracks.
- Multiple IP addresses accessing the same user account from geographically diverse locations may indicate account compromise or unauthorized access.
- Immediate investigation and remediation recommended:
  - Review and block suspicious IPs (especially `73.121.154.15` and `3.80.218.146`).
  - Reset passwords and enforce MFA for affected users.
  - Review mailbox rules and audit mailbox deletions.
  - Monitor for further suspicious activity.
