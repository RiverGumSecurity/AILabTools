### Summary of Normal Activity

- Multiple successful authentications and token issues for users `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` and `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com` from various IP addresses, including internal and external IPs.
- Regular mailbox access and mail item operations by legitimate users, primarily `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` and `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com`.
- Several conditional access policy changes performed by the system account `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)`, indicating routine administrative or automated policy management.
- Use of modern browsers and Microsoft clients (Edge, Chrome, MSWACONSync, OWA) consistent with normal user activity.
- OAuth2 and other modern authentication methods used successfully.
- No anomalous user agents or device types detected in normal activity logs.

### Suspicious Activity Discovered

- Presence of multiple failed login attempts recorded as `UserLoginFailed` events with a `ResultStatus` of "Success" (which is unusual and likely indicates a logging anomaly or a specific Azure AD error code scenario).
- Failed login attempts with error codes such as `50074` ("UserStrongAuthClientAuthNRequiredInterrupt") and `50133` ("SsoArtifactRevoked") indicating authentication interruptions or token revocation.
- The IP address `3.80.218.146` is associated with both failed login attempts and subsequent successful mailbox access and token issuance, indicating possible brute force or credential stuffing attempts followed by successful compromise.
- The IP address `172.221.112.235` shows failed login attempts with `UserLoginFailed` but also multiple successful logins and mailbox accesses, suggesting possible malicious activity or session hijacking.
- The IP address `18.212.101.151` also shows successful logins and mailbox access; while no failed login from this IP is shown, its presence in the context of suspicious IPs warrants attention.
- The user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` is repeatedly targeted with failed login attempts and also shows successful authentications from suspicious IPs.
- The `UserLoginFailed` events have `ResultStatus` "Success" which is contradictory and may indicate that the failure event was logged but the authentication succeeded or was bypassed.
- The presence of multiple IPs with failed login attempts followed by successful authentications for the same user suggests a brute force or password spraying attack that succeeded.
- No other usernames besides `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` show this pattern of failed then successful access from suspicious IPs.

### Conclusion

- The logs indicate a likely brute force or credential stuffing attack targeting user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP addresses `3.80.218.146` and `172.221.112.235`.
- Both IPs show failed login attempts followed by successful authentications and mailbox access, confirming compromise.
- The IP `18.212.101.151` also shows successful login activity for the same user and should be considered suspicious in this context.
- Immediate action is recommended to investigate these IPs further, reset the password for `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`, enable or enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA), and review mailbox access logs for any unauthorized activity or data exfiltration.
- Review and tighten conditional access policies to block or restrict access from suspicious IP ranges.
