Incident Analysis Report  
========================  
**IncidentID:** 20251206-152626  
**LogChunkID:** 30/55  

---  

### Summary of Normal Activity  
- Multiple successful authentications and token issues for users `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` and `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com` from various IP addresses including `34.224.94.68`, `172.221.112.235`, `73.121.154.15`, `2600:387:f:818::4`, and others.  
- Regular mailbox and file operations (MailItemsAccessed, FilePreviewed, FileUploaded, FileModified) by legitimate users.  
- Administrative operations performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)` related to mailbox and conditional access policy management.  
- Use of multiple client applications such as OWA, Edge browser, MSWACONSync, and OAuth tokens issued successfully.  
- No indication of mass failed login attempts or account lockouts in the majority of logs.  

### Suspicious Activity Discovered  
- A `UserLoginFailed` event for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP address `54.219.139.191` on `2024-08-12T16:51:55` with error `FlowTokenExpired` (ErrorNumber: 50089). This indicates a failed login attempt.  
- The same IP address `54.219.139.191` was involved in a successful token issue (`GATFRTokenIssue`) for `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` on `2024-08-09T13:29:19`.  
- The presence of a failed login immediately after successful token issuance from the same IP suggests possible brute force or session hijacking attempts.  
- Conditional Access Policies named "Default Policy" have been repeatedly set to "Disabled" state on multiple occasions (e.g., 2024-08-01, 2024-08-12), which could indicate weakening of security controls.  
- The "PC-Test" Known Networks List policy is active but no direct suspicious activity tied to it.  
- No other explicit brute force or multiple failed login attempts are visible in this chunk, but the combination of failed login with prior success from the same IP is suspicious.  

### IP Source Addresses Involved in Suspicious Activity  
- `54.219.139.191` (Failed login and prior successful token issuance for same user)  
- Note: Other IPs with successful logins appear normal and consistent with user activity.  

### User Account Names Involved in Suspicious Activity  
- `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` (failed login and suspicious token activity)

### Conclusion  
- The logs show evidence of suspicious activity consistent with a possible brute force or token/session misuse attack against user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP address `54.219.139.191`.  
- The failed login event with "FlowTokenExpired" error immediately following successful token issuance from the same IP is suspicious and may indicate attempted unauthorized access or token replay.  
- The repeated disabling of the "Default Policy" Conditional Access Policy is concerning and may represent an attacker weakening security controls to facilitate further compromise.  
- No other user accounts or IP addresses show clear signs of compromise in this log chunk.  

### Recommendations  
- Investigate the source and legitimacy of IP `54.219.139.191`.  
- Review and restore Conditional Access Policies to enforce security controls.  
- Conduct a password reset and multi-factor authentication enforcement for `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`.  
- Monitor for further suspicious login attempts or policy changes.  
- Review other log chunks for additional evidence of brute force or lateral movement.
