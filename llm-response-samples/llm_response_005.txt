LogChunkID: 6/55

### Summary of Normal Activity

- Multiple successful token issuance (GATFRTokenIssue) events for users `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`, `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com`, and `gwootton@usculturaldynamics.com` without associated client IP addresses, typical for internal or trusted token refresh operations.
- Regular mailbox and mail item access by users `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` and `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com` from various IP addresses including `172.221.112.235`, `73.121.154.15`, `34.224.94.68`, `2603:10b6:303:71::13`, and others.
- Conditional Access Policies are being set and updated by system accounts (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)`), reflecting normal administrative maintenance.
- User logins with success status from known IPs and typical user agents (Windows 10, Chrome, Edge, Firefox) for users `jsteele` and `jkapoor`.
- SharePoint and Exchange operations such as file access, list views, mailbox plan settings, and label applications are consistent with normal user activity.

### Suspicious Activity Discovered

- Presence of a **UserLoginFailed** event for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP address `54.219.139.191` with error `SsoArtifactRevoked` (error number 50133). This indicates a failed login attempt due to revoked Single Sign-On token artifact.
- The same IP address `54.219.139.191` also shows **successful** mailbox access and login events for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` shortly after the failed login, indicating possible brute force or credential stuffing attempts that succeeded.
- Multiple distinct IP addresses are observed accessing the same user accounts, including some from geographically diverse locations and IPv6 addresses, which may be unusual depending on the organization's user base.
- No explicit brute force failure bursts are logged in this chunk, but the failed login followed by successful login from the same suspicious IP suggests a possible targeted attack.
- No evidence of new user creation or privilege escalation in this chunk, but the access from suspicious IPs to mailbox data is concerning.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

- The logs show evidence of a suspicious login failure followed by successful mailbox access from the same IP address `54.219.139.191` for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`. This pattern is indicative of a possible brute force or credential stuffing attack that succeeded.
- The IP `54.219.139.191` should be considered malicious and blocked or further investigated.
- User `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`'s account may be compromised and should be immediately reviewed:
  - Force a password reset.
  - Review mailbox and SharePoint access logs for any unauthorized data access or exfiltration.
  - Enable or review multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforcement.
- Review Conditional Access Policies to ensure they are appropriately restrictive and monitor for any unauthorized policy changes.
- Continue monitoring all login attempts, especially from unusual IP addresses or geographic locations.
- Conduct a broader investigation on other log chunks for similar suspicious patterns.
