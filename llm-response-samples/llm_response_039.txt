Incident Analysis Report  
========================  
**IncidentID:** 20251206-152930  
**LogChunkID:** 40/55  

---  

### Summary of Normal Activity  
- Multiple successful user logins primarily by users: `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`, `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com`, and `splanck@usculturaldynamics.com`.  
- Logins originate from a variety of IP addresses, including both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, consistent with normal remote access patterns.  
- Regular mailbox access and file operations (access, update, create) across Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive workloads by legitimate users.  
- Several administrative operations performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)` related to mailbox and policy management, which appear routine and successful.  
- Conditional Access Policies are being set and updated, mostly with "Disabled" state or known network policies, indicating ongoing policy management.  
- Alerts generated are informational and related to mail forwarding/redirect rules creation, which could be normal or require further investigation if unexpected.  

### Suspicious Activity Discovered  
- Presence of a `UserLoginFailed` event with `ResultStatus` marked as `Success` but with an error number `50126` indicating "InvalidUserNameOrPassword" for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP `73.121.154.15`. This suggests a failed login attempt was logged incorrectly as success or a misconfiguration.  
- Multiple successful logins for `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP addresses `73.121.154.15` and `172.221.112.235` and `2600:387:f:6d1a::7` and others, but also failed login attempts from `73.121.154.15`. This pattern may indicate brute force or credential stuffing attempts from this IP.  
- The IP `73.121.154.15` is involved in both failed and successful authentications for the same user, which is suspicious and suggests potential credential compromise or attacker access.  
- An alert for "Creation of forwarding/redirect rule" was triggered (ID: `7e343baf-8b43-4c7e-ebb5-08dca5e05913`) which is a common indicator of account compromise as attackers often set forwarding rules to exfiltrate emails.  
- The forwarding/redirect rule creation alert references user `gwootton@usculturaldynamics.com`, which is not seen in normal login events but has mailbox access logged, indicating possible unauthorized mailbox rule creation.  
- Some IP addresses used for mailbox access and token issuance are external and diverse, including `3.80.218.146`, `44.217.35.149`, and multiple IPv6 addresses; while not necessarily malicious alone, combined with other indicators, they warrant attention.  

### IP Source Addresses Involved in Suspicious Activity  
- `73.121.154.15` (multiple failed and successful login attempts for `jsteele`)  
- `172.221.112.235` (successful logins for `jsteele`)  
- `2600:387:f:6d1a::7` (successful login for `jsteele`)  
- `44.217.35.149` (mailbox access by `gwootton`)  
- `3.80.218.146` (mailbox access by `jsteele`)  

### User Account Names Involved in Suspicious Activity  
- `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` (failed and successful logins, mailbox access, suspicious IP activity)  
- `gwootton@usculturaldynamics.com` (mailbox access, forwarding/redirect rule creation alert)

### Conclusion and Recommendations  
- The logs indicate suspicious activity consistent with a **compromise of user accounts**, particularly `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` and possibly `gwootton@usculturaldynamics.com`.  
- The presence of failed login attempts followed by successful logins from the same IP address suggests possible brute force or credential stuffing attacks that succeeded.  
- The creation of forwarding/redirect rules by `gwootton` is a strong indicator of malicious activity and potential data exfiltration.  
- Immediate actions should include:  
  - Investigate and disable any unauthorized mail forwarding/redirect rules.  
  - Force password resets and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for affected users.  
  - Review and block suspicious IP addresses, especially `73.121.154.15`.  
  - Conduct a thorough mailbox audit for data exfiltration or unauthorized access.  
  - Monitor for further suspicious activity and consider a full incident response investigation.
