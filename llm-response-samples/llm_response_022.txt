### Suspicious Activity Discovered

- There is a recorded "UserLoginFailed" event for user "jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com" from IP address **3.80.218.146** with error "InvalidUserNameOrPassword" (ErrorNumber: 50126).
- Shortly after, there is a successful mailbox access by "jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com" from the same IP address **3.80.218.146**.
- This pattern suggests a possible brute force or credential stuffing attempt from IP 3.80.218.146 that succeeded in authenticating.
- The IP 3.80.218.146 is not seen in other normal activity logs and is distinct from the usual IP addresses used by "jsteele".

- No other users show failed login attempts or suspicious IPs.
