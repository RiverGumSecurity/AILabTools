- Successful user logins (Operation: UserLoggedIn) from various IP addresses for users `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` and `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com`.
- Regular mailbox activities such as mail items accessed, moved to deleted items, and mail sent, primarily by user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`.
- Conditional Access Policies being set and updated by system accounts (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)`), which is typical for Exchange Online management.

### Suspicious Activity Discovered

- There is a log entry for a **UserLoginFailed** event with a `ResultStatus` of "Success" but with a `LogonError` of "InvalidUserNameOrPassword" for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP address `3.80.218.146`. This indicates a failed login attempt.
- The IP address `3.80.218.146` is associated with multiple failed login attempts but also shows evidence of successful mailbox access and token issuance for the same user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`.
- Multiple successful logins and mailbox accesses from IP addresses that are geographically diverse and include both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, some of which are uncommon or suspicious for the organization.
- The presence of multiple IP addresses with failed login attempts followed by successful authentications suggests possible brute force or credential stuffing attacks that eventually succeeded.
- The IP `3.80.218.146` is particularly suspicious due to failed login attempts followed by successful token issuance and mailbox access.
- Other IPs such as `18.212.101.151`, `34.224.94.68`, and `73.121.154.15` also show successful logins and mailbox access, but no failed login attempts are logged from these IPs in this chunk.
- The failed login event's `ResultStatus` is "Success" which is contradictory and could indicate log manipulation or a logging anomaly.

### Conclusion

- The logs indicate a **suspected brute force or credential stuffing attack** targeting user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP address `3.80.218.146`.
- The presence of failed login attempts followed by successful authentication from the same IP strongly suggests that the attacker was able to compromise the account.
- Given the successful mailbox access and token issuance from the suspicious IP, this activity is **malicious**.
- Other users and IPs appear normal with legitimate activity.
- Immediate action is recommended to investigate the user account `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` for potential compromise, reset credentials, review mailbox content for unauthorized activity, and block or monitor the suspicious IP address `3.80.218.146`.
