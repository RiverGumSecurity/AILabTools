### Suspicious Activity Discovered

- There is a recorded event of **UserLoginFailed** at `2024-08-12T15:56:05` with the following details:
  - UserId: `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`
  - ClientIP: `54.219.139.191`
  - Result: Failure with error `InvalidUserNameOrPassword`
  - This indicates a failed login attempt.

- The IP `54.219.139.191` is not seen in successful login events, but there are other IPs with multiple successful logins for the same user.

- No explicit brute force attack pattern (e.g., multiple failed attempts from the same IP) is visible in this chunk, but the presence of failed login attempts from an external IP followed by successful logins from other IPs could indicate reconnaissance or credential stuffing attempts.

- The IP `54.163.19.39` shows a successful login with UserId "Not Available" which is unusual and may indicate an automated or service account or potentially suspicious login.

- The file `passwords.txt` was downloaded via OneDriveSync by user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP `73.121.154.15` on `2024-07-23T11:57:30`. The presence of a file named "passwords.txt" is suspicious and could indicate credential harvesting or data exfiltration.

### Conclusion

- There is evidence of suspicious activity involving failed login attempts from an external IP (54.219.139.191) targeting user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`.

- The presence of a file named "passwords.txt" downloaded by the same user from IP 73.121.154.15 is suspicious and could indicate credential harvesting or data exfiltration.

- The successful login from an IP 54.163.19.39 with UserId "Not Available" is unusual and should be investigated further.

- No clear brute force attack pattern is evident in this log chunk, but the failed login attempt combined with suspicious file activity warrants further investigation.

- Recommend immediate review of user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` account activity, password reset, and investigation of the file "passwords.txt".
