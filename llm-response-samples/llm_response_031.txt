### Summary of Normal Activity

- Multiple successful mailbox and policy configuration changes performed by system account `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)`. These include operations like `Set-Mailbox`, `Set-ConditionalAccessPolicy`, `Set-MailboxPlan`, and `Add-MailboxPermission`.
- Regular user activities by legitimate users including:
  - `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`
  - `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com`
  - `gwootton@usculturaldynamics.com`
  - `jleary@usculturaldynamics.com`
- These users have successful login events (`UserLoggedIn`) from consistent IP addresses and access mailbox items, OneDrive files, and SharePoint pages.
- Typical client applications used include OWA, OneDrive Web App, SharePoint Online Client Extensibility, OneNote, and various Microsoft Exchange services.
- Client IP addresses for legitimate users include:
  - 73.121.154.15 (multiple successful logins and mailbox accesses by `jsteele`)
  - 172.221.112.235 (multiple mailbox accesses by `jsteele`)
  - 3.80.218.146 (mailbox accesses by `jsteele`)
  - 34.224.94.68 (mailbox access by `jkapoor`)
  - 44.217.35.149 (mailbox access by `gwootton`)

### Suspicious Activity Discovered

- Presence of a file named `passwords.txt` accessed via OneDrive Web App by user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP `172.221.112.235`. The filename suggests potential credential exposure or malicious activity.
- Multiple `Set-ConditionalAccessPolicy` operations performed by system account with "DummyKnownNetworkPolicy" and "Known Networks List" policies being modified repeatedly over a short period. This could indicate policy tampering to weaken security controls.
- A phishing email detected and delivered as spam to user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`:
  - Subject: "Act Now: Why Enhanced Network Security is Essential in 2024"
  - Sender IP: 199.15.214.46
  - DKIM and SPF passed but DMARC failed, indicating spoofing.
- No explicit brute force attempts or failed login floods detected in this log chunk.
- No suspicious IP addresses with failed logins followed by successful logins found.
- However, the presence of sensitive file `passwords.txt` and phishing email indicates potential compromise or reconnaissance activity.
