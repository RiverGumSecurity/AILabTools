### Summary of Normal Activity

- Multiple successful operations related to mailbox and device management by system/service accounts (e.g., "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)").
- Regular user activities by legitimate users, primarily `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` and `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com`, including:
  - Successful user logins from consistent IP addresses.
  - Mail items accessed through Outlook Web Access (OWA) and other Microsoft clients.
  - SharePoint and OneDrive file and list operations.
  - Conditional Access Policies being set and updated by system accounts.
  - Token issuance events (GATFRTokenIssue) for authenticated sessions.
- User agents and client applications appear consistent with normal business usage (Edge browser, Firefox, OWA, SharePoint Online Client Extensibility, OneDrive SyncEngine).
- No evidence of failed login flood or brute force attempts in the logs provided.
- Phishing email detected and moved to Junk folder (operation "TIMailData") with spoofing identified but no indication it resulted in compromise.

### Suspicious Activity Discovered

- **UserLoginFailed event with unusual ResultStatus 'Success' but LogonError "UserStrongAuthClientAuthNRequiredInterrupt"** from IP `3.80.218.146` on 2024-08-06T20:57:20. This indicates a failed login due to strong authentication requirement but logged as success, which may indicate an authentication anomaly or misconfiguration.
- Multiple successful authentications and mailbox accesses from IP addresses that are geographically diverse and unusual for the organization, including:
  - `3.80.218.146` (multiple mail access and login failure events)
  - `54.163.19.39`
  - `54.219.139.191`
  - `34.224.94.68`
  - `172.221.112.235`
- These IPs are not typical internal or corporate IP ranges and may be cloud or external ISP IPs, raising suspicion about possible unauthorized access.
- The user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` has multiple mailbox accesses and user logins from these external IPs, indicating possible account compromise.
- The user `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com` also shows mailbox access and logins from external IPs such as `34.224.94.68` and IPv6 addresses.
- The presence of "UserId": "Not Available" in some login events with successful status and external IPs (e.g., `54.163.19.39`) could indicate automated or service-based access that should be reviewed.
- Conditional Access Policies are frequently updated and some are disabled (state: "Disabled"), which could be an attacker attempting to weaken security controls.

### Specific Log Data of Concern

1. **UserLoginFailed with anomalous success status**  
   - Time: 2024-08-06T20:57:20  
   - IP: 3.80.218.146  
   - LogonError: UserStrongAuthClientAuthNRequiredInterrupt  
   - UserId: Not Available  
   - Indicates potential authentication issues or bypass attempts.

2. **Multiple successful mailbox accesses and logins from external IPs**  
   - User: `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`  
   - IPs: 3.80.218.146, 54.163.19.39, 54.219.139.191, 172.221.112.235  
   - Operations: MailItemsAccessed, UserLoggedIn, GATFRTokenIssue  
   - Suggests possible unauthorized access or session hijacking.

3. **Conditional Access Policy changes**  
   - Frequent updates and disabling of policies (e.g., "Default Policy" disabled multiple times) by system account  
   - Times: 2024-07-17, 2024-08-07, 2024-08-08  
   - Could indicate attacker attempting to weaken security posture.

4. **Phishing email detected and delivered to Junk**  
   - Operation: TIMailData  
   - Time: 2024-08-08T15:36:51  
   - SenderIp: 199.15.215.77  
   - Verdict: Phish  
   - No direct compromise shown but indicates targeted phishing attempt.

---

### Conclusion

The logs show no brute force attack pattern but reveal suspicious successful authentications and mailbox accesses from multiple external IP addresses for key user accounts (`jsteele` and `jkapoor`). The disabling of Conditional Access Policies and anomalous login failure events with success status are concerning and suggest possible account compromise or attacker activity.

**Recommended actions:**

- Immediately investigate and verify legitimacy of logins from external IPs listed.
- Review and restore Conditional Access Policies to enforce security controls.
- Conduct password resets and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for affected users.
- Monitor for further suspicious activity and consider forensic analysis of affected accounts.
- Investigate the phishing email incident for potential impact.
