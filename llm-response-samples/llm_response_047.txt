### Summary of Normal Activity

- Multiple successful mailbox access and mail item operations by legitimate users, primarily `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` and `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com`.
- Regular use of Microsoft Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Azure Active Directory services.
- Conditional access policies and mailbox plans are being set and updated by system accounts (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)`), consistent with normal administrative operations.
- Frequent issuance of tokens (GATFRTokenIssue) for users, indicating normal authentication and authorization flows.
- Various file and folder operations (access, modification, download) performed by legitimate users.
- User agents and client IPs correspond to typical corporate environments and known client applications (OWA, Edge, REST clients).
- No large-scale failed login attempts or brute force indicators in this log chunk.
- Some login failures are recorded but appear isolated and followed by successful logins.

### Suspicious Activity Discovered

- There is a **UserLoginFailed** event for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP `172.221.112.235` with a logon error `SsoArtifactRevoked` (ErrorNumber: 50133). This indicates a failed single sign-on token but the status is marked as "Success" which is contradictory and suspicious.
- The IP address `172.221.112.235` is also associated with successful logins and other operations by `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`, indicating potential suspicious activity from this IP.
- The IP `172.221.112.235` is an external IP and is involved in both failed and successful authentication events for the same user, which may indicate a compromised session or attacker attempting to authenticate.
- No explicit brute force attack patterns (multiple failed logins in short time) are visible in this log chunk, but the presence of failed login followed by successful login from the same suspicious IP is concerning.
- No other unusual usernames or unknown accounts detected in this log chunk.
- No evidence of privilege escalation or unusual administrative activity by user accounts other than system accounts.
