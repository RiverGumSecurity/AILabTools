### Summary of Normal Activity

- Multiple successful mailbox access operations by known users (e.g., `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`, `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com`, `nreynell@usculturaldynamics.com`, `jleary@usculturaldynamics.com`, `splanck@usculturaldynamics.com`).
- Regular mailbox operations include reading, moving, and accessing mail items primarily from internal or expected IP addresses.
- Several successful user login events from legitimate IP addresses and user agents, including Windows 10 devices using browsers like Edge, Chrome, and Firefox.
- Routine administrative operations performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)` related to mailbox and conditional access policy configurations.
- OAuth token issuance events for legitimate users and applications.
- SharePoint and OneDrive file access and modifications by legitimate users and service accounts.
- Low severity security alerts related to user email submissions marking emails as not junk, which is typical user behavior.

### Suspicious Activity Discovered

- Multiple **UserLoginFailed** events with `ResultStatus` marked as **Success** but with error details indicating authentication failures requiring strong authentication (`UserStrongAuthClientAuthNRequiredInterrupt`).
- These failed login attempts originate from IP address `172.221.112.235`.
- Despite failed login attempts, the same IP address (`172.221.112.235`) later shows multiple successful login events for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`.
- The presence of failed login attempts followed by successful authentications from the same IP suggests possible brute force or credential stuffing attempts that eventually succeeded.
- The IP `172.221.112.235` is associated with both failed and successful authentications, indicating potential malicious activity.
- No other IP addresses show a similar pattern of failed then successful logins.
- No explicit evidence of other brute force attacks or suspicious mailbox permission changes by unknown users.
- The user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` is the primary account involved in suspicious login activity.

### Specific Log Data of Concern

1. Failed login event with suspicious success status but error detail:

```json
{
  "CreationTime": "2024-08-12T15:58:29",
  "Id": "07f91da1-cbf1-4830-a4b4-70f492392b00",
  "Operation": "UserLoginFailed",
  "ResultStatus": "Success",
  "UserId": "Not Available",
  "ClientIP": "172.221.112.235",
  "ErrorNumber": "50074",
  "LogonError": "UserStrongAuthClientAuthNRequiredInterrupt"
}
```

2. Subsequent successful login events from same IP and user:

```json
{
  "CreationTime": "2024-08-12T15:59:21",
  "Id": "35f6d461-dfae-49e0-80af-813453759100",
  "Operation": "UserLoggedIn",
  "ResultStatus": "Success",
  "UserId": "jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com",
  "ClientIP": "172.221.112.235"
}
```

```json
{
  "CreationTime": "2024-08-12T15:58:26",
  "Id": "f781b810-4bf2-40b9-ae47-3fd85a062b00",
  "Operation": "UserLoggedIn",
  "ResultStatus": "Success",
  "UserId": "Not Available",
  "ClientIP": "172.221.112.235"
}
```

3. Multiple mailbox access operations by `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP `172.221.112.235` shortly after successful login.

# Conclusion

The logs show evidence of a possible brute force or credential stuffing attack targeting the user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP address `172.221.112.235`. The attacker experienced multiple failed login attempts requiring strong authentication but eventually succeeded in authenticating. The successful logins from this IP and user, followed by mailbox access, indicate a malicious compromise.

# Recommendations

- Immediately investigate and potentially block IP `172.221.112.235`.
- Force password reset and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`.
- Review mailbox and account activity for any unauthorized changes or data exfiltration.
- Monitor for further suspicious login attempts or anomalous activity.
- Review and tighten conditional access policies to enforce strong authentication requirements.
