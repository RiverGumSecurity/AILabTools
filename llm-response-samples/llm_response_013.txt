### Summary of Normal Activity

- Multiple successful authentication events for users `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`, `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com`, and `gwootton@usculturaldynamics.com` from various IP addresses including `73.121.154.15`, `34.224.94.68`, `2603:10b6:5:fe::10`, and others.
- Regular Exchange and SharePoint operations such as token issuance, mailbox access, mailbox plan settings, conditional access policy changes by system accounts (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`), and file/list access.
- User logins mostly successful with expected client apps and browsers (Edge, Firefox, Chrome) and typical device OS (Windows 10, Android).
- Some administrative and system configuration changes performed by Exchange service accounts, which appear legitimate.
- Alerts of low severity related to user email submissions (e.g., "Email reported by user as not junk") with no indication of malicious activity.

### Suspicious Activity Discovered

- Presence of a **UserLoginFailed** event for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP address `54.219.139.191` with error `InvalidUserNameOrPassword` (LogonError: 50126) indicating a failed login attempt.
- The same IP address `54.219.139.191` later shows a **successful** MailItemsAccessed event for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`, indicating a successful authentication after a failed login attempt.
- This pattern suggests a possible **brute force or credential guessing attack** from IP `54.219.139.191` targeting user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`.
- The successful authentication from the suspicious IP indicates potential compromise or unauthorized access.
- No other failed login attempts or brute force patterns are evident in this log chunk for other IPs or users.
