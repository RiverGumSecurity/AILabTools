### Summary of Normal Activity

- Multiple successful mailbox access events by legitimate users such as `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`, `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com`, and `gwootton@usculturaldynamics.com` from various IP addresses, mostly consistent with corporate or known user IP ranges.
- Regular issuance of GATFR tokens (OAuth tokens) for these users, indicating normal authentication flows.
- Routine administrative operations performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)` related to mailbox plans, conditional access policies, and transport configurations.
- File access and modifications in OneDrive and SharePoint by legitimate users, consistent with normal business activities.
- Sensitivity labels applied to emails and documents, indicating data classification and protection policies in place.
- Threat Intelligence event showing a phishing email detected and moved to Junk folder, with no indication that it was successful.

### Suspicious Activity Discovered

- **No explicit brute force or failed login attempts are present in this log chunk**, so no direct evidence of brute force attacks.
- However, **several Conditional Access Policies were repeatedly disabled or modified** by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)`:
  - Multiple `Set-ConditionalAccessPolicy` operations show the "Default Policy" being disabled multiple times (e.g., on 7/15/2024, 7/18/2024, 7/27/2024, 8/8/2024).
  - Disabling or modifying Conditional Access Policies can weaken security controls and may indicate malicious activity or misconfiguration.
- **Addition of a new service principal named "Azure Files"** with credentials added on 7/24/2024:
  - `Add service principal.` operation with `DisplayName` "Azure Files" and enabled account.
  - Service principals can be used for automation but also for persistence or lateral movement if unauthorized.
- Several file accesses from unusual or external IP addresses (e.g., `52.108.181.1`, `3.80.218.146`, `73.121.154.15`) by user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`.
- A phishing email detected with sender IP `199.15.214.50` targeting `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`, indicating attempted external compromise.
- No direct evidence of compromised credentials or successful logins from suspicious IPs in this log chunk.
- However, the repeated disabling of Conditional Access Policies and creation of service principal may indicate a **compromise or insider threat**.

### IP Source Addresses Involved in Suspicious Activity

- `52.108.181.1` — File accessed by `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` via OneDrive.
- `3.80.218.146` — File accessed by `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` via SharePoint.
- `73.121.154.15` — Mailbox accessed by `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`.
- `199.15.214.50` — Sender IP of phishing email detected targeting internal user.
- No brute force IPs identified, but these IPs are notable for external access or suspicious activity.

---

### User Account Names Involved in Suspicious Activity

- `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` — Target of phishing email, multiple accesses from unusual IPs.
- `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)` — Performed multiple Conditional Access Policy disables and mailbox configurations; this is a system account but the repeated disabling of policies is suspicious.
- No other user accounts show suspicious authentication patterns in this log chunk.

### Specific Log Data of Concern

1. **Repeated Disabling of Conditional Access Policies:**

```json
{
  "Operation": "Set-ConditionalAccessPolicy",
  "ResultStatus": "True",
  "UserId": "NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)",
  "Parameters": [
    {"Name": "PolicyDetails", "Value": "{\"Version\":0,\"State\":\"Disabled\"}"},
    {"Name": "DisplayName", "Value": "Default Policy"}
  ],
  "CreationTime": "Multiple dates: 7/15/2024, 7/18/2024, 7/27/2024, 8/8/2024"
}
```

2. **Addition of Service Principal "Azure Files":**

```json
{
  "Operation": "Add service principal.",
  "ResultStatus": "Success",
  "UserId": "ServicePrincipal_c23ab169-517c-42a2-a4a9-766fbe8e8e8c",
  "ModifiedProperties": [
    {"Name": "AccountEnabled", "NewValue": "[true]"},

  ],
  "CreationTime": "2024-07-24T09:51:49"
}
```

3. **Phishing Email Detected:**

```json
{
  "Operation": "TIMailData",
  "ResultStatus": "DeliveredAsSpam",
  "UserId": "ThreatIntel",
  "SenderIp": "199.15.214.50",
  "Recipients": ["jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com"],
  "Subject": "Is Your SOC Ready for AI’s Next Big Breakthrough? Learn How in Our Live Panel!",
  "DetectionType": "Inline",
  "Verdict": "Phish"
}
```

4. **Unusual External IP File Accesses by `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`:**

- IP: `52.108.181.1` (OneDrive file access)
- IP: `3.80.218.146` (SharePoint file access)
- IP: `73.121.154.15` (Mailbox access)

# Conclusion

- There is no direct evidence of brute force attacks or failed login attempts in this log chunk.
- However, the repeated disabling of Conditional Access Policies is highly suspicious and could indicate an attacker or insider weakening security controls.
- The creation of a new service principal with credentials ("Azure Files") could be a persistence mechanism.
- A phishing email was detected targeting a key user (`jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`), which could be an initial vector for compromise.
- External IP addresses accessing files and mailboxes of `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` may be legitimate but warrant further investigation due to their diversity and some being non-corporate IPs.
- Recommend immediate review and re-enabling of Conditional Access Policies, investigation of the service principal creation, and monitoring or blocking of suspicious IP addresses.
- User accounts `jsteele` and `jkapoor` should be monitored for unusual activity, and phishing awareness reinforced.

If further log chunks are available, analysis of failed login attempts and other authentication events would be useful to confirm or refute compromise hypotheses.
