- Multiple successful mailbox access events by legitimate users such as `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`, `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com`, and `gwootton@usculturaldynamics.com`.
- Regular issuance of tokens (`GATFRTokenIssue`) for users, indicating normal authentication and token refresh activity.
- Conditional access policies being set and updated by system accounts (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)`), which is typical for Exchange Online management.
- Normal file access and modifications on OneDrive and SharePoint by legitimate users.
- Mail items being accessed and emails being sent by legitimate users.
- Authentication events show successful logins from consistent IP addresses and user agents for known users.
- Some phishing email detection and quarantine by Threat Intelligence system (e.g., a phishing email sent to `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` was detected and moved to JunkFolder).
