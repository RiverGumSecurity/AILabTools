### Summary of Normal Activity

- Multiple successful token issuance events (Operation: GATFRTokenIssue) for users `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` and `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com` with no ClientIP logged in some cases, which is typical for internal or service-issued tokens.
- Regular mailbox access and mail item operations (MailItemsAccessed, Create) by legitimate users such as `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`, `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com`, and `jleary@usculturaldynamics.com` from consistent IP addresses.
- Conditional Access Policies are being set and updated by the system account `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)` as part of normal Exchange management.
- User logins (UserLoggedIn) for known users with successful status from various IP addresses, mostly consistent with user activity, including OAuth2 authorization flows.
- OneDrive and SharePoint activities such as file modifications, folder creations, and page views by legitimate users and applications.
- Sensitivity labels applied to emails by users, consistent with organizational data protection policies.
- IP addresses used for normal activity include both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, such as `73.121.154.15`, `34.224.94.68`, `172.221.112.235`, `2600:387:15:3814::9`, `2603:10b6:5:fe::10`, and others.

### Suspicious Activity Discovered

- No explicit brute force or failed login attempts are logged in this chunk, so no direct evidence of brute force attack.
- However, there are multiple successful login and token issuance events from a wide range of IP addresses, including some that are uncommon or geographically diverse, which may indicate potential account compromise or lateral movement.
- Notably, the user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` has successful logins and mailbox access from multiple distinct IP addresses, including:
  - IPv4: `73.121.154.15`, `172.221.112.235`, `54.163.19.39`, `52.108.181.1`
  - IPv6: `2600:387:15:3814::9`, `2600:387:15:1f16::b`, `2603:10b6:2404::17`, `2603:10b6:5:fe::10`, `2603:10b6:2400::39`, `2600:387:f:6d1a::7`, `2600:387:f:818::4`
- Some of these IP addresses (e.g., `54.163.19.39`, `52.108.181.1`) are cloud provider IPs (AWS ranges), which may be unusual for normal user activity.
- The user `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com` also has successful logins from IP `34.224.94.68` (AWS IP range).
- The presence of multiple Conditional Access Policy changes by system account with some policies disabled or modified could be suspicious if not authorized.
- The diversity and volume of IP addresses used by the same user in a short timeframe could indicate account misuse or session hijacking.
- The user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` has multiple OAuth and FormsCookieAuth authentications from different IPs and devices, which may indicate session hijacking or token theft.
- No failed login attempts are visible in this chunk, but the successful logins from unusual IPs warrant further investigation.

### Specific Log Data of Concern

- Multiple `UserLoggedIn` events for `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from IPs:  
  - `172.221.112.235` (2024-08-06T19:10:48, 2024-08-07T13:17:49, 2024-08-12T22:25:02)  
  - `73.121.154.15` (2024-07-24T12:25:39)  
  - `2600:387:15:1f16::b` (2024-08-08T14:31:49)  
  - `2600:387:f:6d1a::7` (2024-07-23T12:02:31)  
- `UserLoggedIn` for `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com` from IP `34.224.94.68` (2024-07-19T12:54:35)  
- `MailItemsAccessed` by `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` from multiple IPs including `73.121.154.15`, `172.221.112.235`, `2603:10b6:5:fe::10`  
- `FileModifiedExtended` and `FileAccessed` operations from IPs `23.101.184.74`, `20.253.167.42`, `52.108.181.1`, which are cloud IPs and may be unusual.  
- Multiple `Set-ConditionalAccessPolicy` operations by system account modifying policies, including disabling default policies and setting known networks list, which could weaken security posture if unauthorized.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

- There is no direct evidence of brute force attack in this log chunk, but the wide range of IP addresses used by key users, especially `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`, including cloud provider IPs, is suspicious and could indicate account compromise or misuse.
- The successful authentications from these diverse IPs should be investigated further, including correlating with user activity and verifying if these IPs are legitimate or associated with VPNs or proxies.
- Review recent Conditional Access Policy changes for unauthorized modifications that could have reduced security controls.
- Recommend immediate password resets and multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforcement for affected users.
- Conduct a full audit of user sessions and revoke any suspicious or unknown active sessions.
- Monitor for any unusual data access or exfiltration activity following these logins.

If further log chunks or failed login attempts are available, they should be reviewed to confirm if brute force or credential stuffing attacks are occurring.
