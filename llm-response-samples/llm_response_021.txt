Incident Analysis Report  
========================  
IncidentID: 20251206-152347  
LogChunkID: 22/55  

1. Summary of Normal Activity  
-----------------------------  
- Multiple successful operations related to Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams workloads.  
- Regular user activities such as file access, mail item access, message sending, calendar item creation, and label application observed for users:  
  - jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com  
  - jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com  
  - gwootton@usculturaldynamics.com  
- Authentication token issuance (GATFRTokenIssue) events are common and mostly successful, indicating normal OAuth token refresh and usage.  
- Conditional access policies and mailbox plans are being updated by system accounts (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM), which is normal for Exchange service operations.  
- User agent strings and client apps are consistent with typical user behavior (Edge, Chrome, OWA, REST clients).  
- No unusual or failed login storms detected in the logs provided.  

2. Suspicious Activity Discovered  
---------------------------------  
- There is one event labeled "UserLoginFailed" with Operation: UserLoginFailed but ResultStatus: Success, which is contradictory and suspicious. The event:  
  - CreationTime: 2024-08-12T16:37:58  
  - Id: cf3b1a4e-4e5b-489f-b0d5-3fccc62e8b00  
  - UserId: jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com  
  - ClientIP: 172.221.112.235  
  - LogonError: FlowTokenExpired  
  This indicates a login failure event recorded as success, possibly a logging anomaly or a token replay attempt.  
- The IP address 172.221.112.235 is seen in this suspicious login failure event and also in successful mail access events for user jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com, indicating that this IP address has authenticated successfully at some point.  
- The presence of multiple IP addresses with failed or unusual login attempts is not evident in this chunk, but the contradictory login failure event is notable.  
- No brute force attack pattern (multiple failed logins from same IP or user) is observed in this data chunk.  
- No evidence of account enumeration or multiple usernames used in suspicious manner.  

3. IP Source Addresses Involved in Suspicious Activity  
-----------------------------------------------------  
- 172.221.112.235 (associated with suspicious login failure event but also successful authentication)  

4. User Account Names Involved in Suspicious Activity  
----------------------------------------------------  
- jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com (user involved in suspicious login failure event and successful authentications from same IP)  

5. Specific Log Data of Concern

```

- This event shows a login failure operation but with a success result status, indicating a possible token replay or session hijacking attempt.  
- The IP address 172.221.112.235 is also seen in successful mail access events for the same user, which suggests this IP is malicious or compromised.  

---

**Conclusion:**  
- No clear brute force or credential stuffing attack patterns detected in this log chunk.  
- However, the contradictory login failure event with success status and the presence of the same IP address in successful authentications is suspicious and may indicate a token replay or session hijacking attack.  
- The user account jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com and IP 172.221.112.235 should be investigated further for potential compromise.  
- Recommend monitoring for additional suspicious login failures, unusual token usage, and reviewing conditional access policies for this user and IP.

If additional log chunks are available, further correlation is recommended to confirm attack patterns or lateral movement.
