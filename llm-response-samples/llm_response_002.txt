### Suspicious Activity Discovered

- There is a **UserLoginFailed** event at 2024-08-12T16:43:20 for user "jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com" from IP address 3.80.218.146 with error "InvalidUserNameOrPassword". This indicates a failed login attempt.
- However, the same IP address (3.80.218.146) also has a successful login event for "jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com" at 2024-08-06T21:02:25 and other successful logins, indicating the IP is associated with successful authentication.
- The presence of failed login attempts followed by successful logins from the same IP address may indicate a **brute force or credential stuffing attack** that succeeded.
- The IP 3.80.218.146 is suspicious because it shows both failed and successful logins for the same user, which is a hallmark of malicious activity.
- Additionally, there is a phishing email detected and delivered as spam to "jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com" on 2024-08-08 from sender IP 199.15.214.48, indicating possible external threat activity targeting the user.
- Several conditional access policies were set or modified by the system account "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)" with some policies disabled or changed, which could be normal but should be reviewed for policy changes that weaken security.
- The resource URLs in token issuance include suspicious endpoints such as "https://webshell.suite.office.com" and "https://dataservice.o365filtering.com" which are unusual and may indicate use of non-standard or potentially malicious applications or services.
