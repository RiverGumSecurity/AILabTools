### Summary of Normal Activity

- Multiple successful mailbox access and mail item operations performed by legitimate users, primarily `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` and `jkapoor@usculturaldynamics.com`.
- Regular token issuance events (GATFRTokenIssue) for users, indicating normal authentication token requests.
- Conditional Access Policy changes and mailbox configuration changes performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Microsoft.Exchange.ServiceHost)`, consistent with system or administrative activity.
- User logins from consistent IP addresses such as `172.221.112.235`, `73.121.154.15`, `34.224.94.68`, and IPv6 addresses like `2600:387:f:818::4` and `2600:387:15:1f16::b`.
- Activity includes SharePoint page views, Teams sessions, and sensitivity label applications, consistent with normal user operations.
- User agents and client apps correspond to legitimate browsers and Microsoft Office clients.

### Suspicious Activity Discovered

- No explicit brute force or failed login attempts are shown in this log chunk.
- However, there are multiple successful logins and mailbox access events from IP addresses that are external and geographically diverse, including:
  - `3.80.218.146`
  - `54.163.19.39`
  - `40.126.8.40`
- These IP addresses are associated with successful authentication and mailbox access by user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`.
- The IP `54.163.19.39` shows a successful login with user ID "Not Available" but is linked to AzureActiveDirectory events and an Actor IP address of `54.163.19.39`. This could indicate a service or automated login or a suspicious anomaly.
- The presence of multiple external IP addresses accessing the mailbox of `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` could indicate account compromise or unauthorized access.
- The user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` has mailbox access and token issuance from multiple IPs, including some that are not consistent with the usual IPs (`172.221.112.235`, `73.121.154.15`).
- No direct evidence of brute force attacks in this chunk, but suspicious external IPs with successful authentication are a concern.

### Conclusion

- The logs do not show brute force attempts or failed login floods.
- However, the presence of multiple successful logins and mailbox accesses from unusual external IP addresses for user `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com` is suspicious and likely indicates account compromise.
- The IP `54.163.19.39` login with "Not Available" user ID but linked to `jsteele` user context is suspicious and may indicate unauthorized or automated access.
- Immediate actions recommended:
  - Investigate the external IPs `3.80.218.146`, `54.163.19.39`, and `40.126.8.40` for geolocation and threat intelligence.
  - Review account activity and reset credentials for `jsteele@usculturaldynamics.com`.
  - Enable or enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) if not already in place.
  - Monitor for further suspicious activity from these IPs or accounts.

If further log chunks are available, a broader analysis could confirm if brute force or other attack patterns exist.
