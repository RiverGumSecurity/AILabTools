# Incident Response Analysis Report

---

## Consolidated Findings

- **Attack Type:**  
  The logs across all chunks show a sustained, large-scale, distributed brute force and password spraying campaign targeting the SSH service on the Linux host `db-ir-testing2`.

- **Attack Characteristics:**  
  - High volume of SSH authentication attempts from numerous external IP addresses worldwide.  
  - Repeated failed login attempts for a wide variety of usernames, mostly invalid/non-existent users, but also targeting valid users such as `root`, `user`, and notably `dbanks`.  
  - Many connection attempts end with disconnects shortly after failed authentication or pre-authentication disconnects, typical of automated scanning or brute force tools.  
  - Some IPs exceed maximum authentication attempts, triggering disconnects.  
  - Attempts include common administrative usernames (`root`, `admin`, `oracle`, `ubuntu`, `postgres`, `ftpuser`, etc.) and a broad range of other usernames, indicating credential stuffing and username enumeration.  
  - Several IPs attempt to change usernames mid-connection (rejected by the server), indicating sophisticated attack tactics.  
  - No successful authentication entries for most chunks; however, in later chunks (notably LogChunkID 32/55 and 51/55), there is evidence of successful public key and password authentication for users `root` and `dbanks` from IP `173.71.141.150`. This suggests a likely compromise or unauthorized access.  
  - The IP `64.42.179.59` is a persistent source of brute force attempts targeting `root` and `dbanks`, with a very high volume of failed attempts but no successful login recorded in the analyzed chunks.  
  - Other IPs such as `193.37.254.3` show repeated failed attempts targeting `root` and `dbanks`, indicating focused brute force attacks.  
  - Numerous other IP addresses participate in scanning and brute force attempts with invalid usernames, indicating a broad distributed attack.  

- **Usernames Under Attack:**  
  - **Valid users targeted:**  
    - `root` (most heavily targeted)  
    - `user`  
    - `dbanks` (targeted heavily from IPs like 64.42.179.59 and 193.37.254.3)  
    - `www-data` (some failed attempts)  
  - **Invalid/non-existent users:**  
    - Hundreds of usernames including common defaults and popular service accounts (e.g., admin, ubuntu, oracle, postgres, ftpuser, jenkins, teamspeak, test, guest, mysql, deployer, etc.)  
    - Many unique invalid usernames attempted repeatedly from multiple IPs, indicating automated scanning and credential stuffing.  

- **Suspicious IP Addresses:**  
  - **High-volume brute force sources:**  
    - `64.42.179.59` (persistent brute force on `root` and `dbanks`)  
    - `173.71.141.150` (successful authentication for `root` and `dbanks` after failed attempts)  
    - `193.37.254.3` (focused brute force on `root` and `dbanks`)  
    - `165.22.60.53` (multiple failed attempts for invalid and valid users)  
    - `185.246.130.20` (high volume, username changes mid-connection)  
    - `167.99.153.197` (targeted brute force on `user` and many invalid users)  
    - `185.217.127.195` (aggressive brute force with many invalid usernames)  
    - `118.91.57.124`, `45.180.196.35`, `194.110.203.122`, `179.60.147.143`, `195.226.194.142`, `43.153.211.104`, `104.248.31.56`, `43.204.222.181`, `212.33.250.241`, `187.141.135.181`, `109.115.187.31`, `64.42.179.35`, `64.42.179.59`, and many others involved in scanning and brute force attempts.  

- **Timeline and Persistence:**  
  - The attacks are persistent and continuous over the observed log period, with repeated attempts from the same IPs and usernames.  
  - No confirmed successful compromises are evident in the majority of log chunks, except for the confirmed successful public key and password authentication for `root` and `dbanks` from IP `173.71.141.150` in later chunks, indicating a likely breach.  
  - The attack volume and diversity of usernames and IPs indicate a coordinated, distributed brute force and credential stuffing campaign.

## Assessment of Compromise Likelihood

- **Confirmed Compromise:**  
  - The successful public key authentication for `root` and password authentication for `dbanks` from IP `173.71.141.150` strongly indicates a successful compromise or unauthorized access.  
  - This IP had prior failed attempts before successful login, suggesting attacker persistence and eventual success.

- **High Risk:**  
  - The persistent, high-volume brute force attacks targeting `root`, `dbanks`, and other valid users from multiple IPs indicate a high risk of compromise if weak credentials exist.  
  - The presence of many invalid user attempts and password spraying attempts increases the likelihood that attackers are probing for valid accounts and weak passwords.

- **No Confirmed Compromise:**  
  - For the majority of other IPs and usernames, no explicit successful authentication is logged, indicating no confirmed compromise in those cases.  
  - However, the volume and persistence of attempts warrant immediate mitigation to prevent successful breaches.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Immediate Incident Response Actions:**  
   - Investigate the sessions and activities associated with IP `173.71.141.150` for `root` and `dbanks` users to determine scope and impact of the compromise.  
   - Review system logs beyond authentication (e.g., process, file, network logs) for signs of lateral movement, persistence, or data exfiltration.  
   - Revoke and rotate SSH keys and passwords for `root`, `dbanks`, and other critical accounts.  
   - Conduct a full system integrity check and forensic analysis.

2. **Mitigation of Ongoing Attacks:**  
   - Implement or verify rate limiting and automatic blocking (e.g., fail2ban) for IPs with repeated failed login attempts.  
   - Block or blacklist high-volume attacking IP addresses at the firewall or network perimeter.  
   - Disable password authentication for SSH; enforce key-based authentication only.  
   - Disable root login over SSH (`PermitRootLogin no`) to reduce attack surface.  
   - Enforce strong password policies and consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for SSH access.

3. **Monitoring and Alerting:**  
   - Enhance monitoring for any successful authentication events, especially following multiple failures.  
   - Set up alerts for suspicious login patterns, including multiple failed attempts, username changes mid-connection, and logins from unusual IPs.  
   - Continuously monitor for lateral movement and unusual system behavior.

4. **Access Control Improvements:**  
   - Restrict SSH access to trusted IP addresses or VPNs where feasible.  
   - Regularly audit user accounts and remove or disable unused or default accounts.  
   - Review and harden SSH configuration to minimize attack vectors.

5. **User Awareness and Training:**  
   - Inform system administrators and users about the attack and encourage vigilance.  
   - Educate on the importance of strong authentication methods and account security.

---

**Summary:**  
The system is under a large-scale, distributed brute force and password spraying attack targeting SSH. There is confirmed successful authentication for critical users from a suspicious IP, indicating likely compromise. Immediate investigation and mitigation are critical to prevent further damage and secure the environment.
