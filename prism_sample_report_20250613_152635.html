                    <p>THREAT INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY</p>
<p>Title: FIN6 LinkedIn Campaign Leveraging AWS Infrastructure</p>
<p>Threat Actor: FIN6 (financially-motivated APT group)
Primary Malware: More_eggs (aka Terra Loader, SpicyOmelette)
Attack Vector: LinkedIn-based social engineering + malicious AWS-hosted resumes</p>
<p>Technical Details:
- Threat actor creates fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn
- Targets receive connection requests and job opportunities
- Victims are directed to AWS-hosted malicious resume files
- More_eggs malware is delivered via JavaScript-based downloader
- Uses legitimate AWS infrastructure to evade detection
- Malware employs DLL side-loading techniques for persistence</p>
<p>Key IOCs:
- AWS URLs hosting fake resumes (specific URLs pending)
- More_eggs malware signatures
- Suspicious LinkedIn recruiter profiles with recent creation dates
- JavaScript downloaders masquerading as resume files</p>
<p>Targeted Sectors:
- Financial services
- Retail
- Hospitality
- Point-of-sale systems
- Corporate HR departments</p>
<p>Impact/Severity: HIGH
- Provides initial access for ransomware deployment
- Potential for data theft and financial fraud
- Leverages trusted platforms (LinkedIn, AWS)
- High success rate due to social engineering</p>
<p>Recommended Mitigations:
1. Implement strict LinkedIn usage policies
2. Deploy advanced email filtering for job-related communications
3. Block unauthorized AWS storage URLs
4. Monitor for suspicious DLL loading patterns
5. Train HR staff on social engineering awareness
6. Enable PowerShell logging and monitoring
7. Implement application allowlisting
8. Deploy EDR solutions with behavioral detection</p>
<p>Additional Notes:
This campaign demonstrates FIN6's continued evolution in social engineering tactics and abuse of legitimate cloud services. Organizations should particularly focus on protecting HR departments and monitoring LinkedIn communications.</p>
